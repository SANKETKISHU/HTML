<tr><td colspan="9"><h2>Food of Delhi</h2><p>You can shop till you drop and it still won't be enough for your heart's desire. One of the many great things about Delhi is its wide variety of street markets to shop from, where the malls and posh showrooms take a backseat and are replaced with makeshift shops. Street shopping, commonly known as patri shopping is something almost every Delhi girl is well versed with. If you're comfortable enough to step into crowded galis, get your bargaining game on, thenyou're going to have an amazing adventure while you shop in these street markets. Finding something that can make your day instantly won't be a wonder</p>
<p>Whether you're looking for clothes, shoes, accessories, electronics or handicrafts, you can find it all on the streets. Its true that shopping in a mall is a comfortable experience, but you'll have the best shopping experience on the very streets of Delhi. These places always have cute things for sale that don't pinch your pocket all that much. We have come up with a handy list of all the street markets you can hit for the best shopping experience</p>
